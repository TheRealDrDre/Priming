# Inter-trial effects in ACT-R

This is a general model for inter-trial effects. By inter-trial
effects I mean _priming_ effects,  or any other automatic processing
a specific stimulus _S_ at time _t_ following the processing of
another stimulus at time _t - 1_. These effects include, but are not
limited to,  _Semantic priming_ effects as typically seen in lexical
decision tasks.

Some other effects, such as the __Gratton effect__ (that is,
adjustments in control following a  given stimulus) and the __Negative
priming__ effects, might be due to effects in control.

## How does it happen?

In ACT-R, there is no continuity in spreading activation, but that's
not a problem.

The main idea is that cognition does flexible multitasking. When a
stimulus is processed, automatic retrieval will cause the retrieval of
information. So processing stimulys _S1_ at time _t_ will cause the
retrieval buffer to be filled up.

At time _t + 1_, the retrieval of information for _S2_ will be
affected by what has been retrieved for _S1_. This nicely explains
semantic priming. It probably explains negative priming in the Stroop
effect as well.

## Predictions

The main idea is that priming results from optimal scheduling for
processing resources. High-functioning individuals are good at
removing interfering stuff from WM. Thus, they should show __smaller__
priming effects.

But why do high-WM people show greater Semantic Priming?
